# hello-world

Creating this repo on my Chromebook Flip. 
Running Version 59.0.3065.0 (Official Build) dev (32-bit), which is rather buggy. Crashes sometimes. Is known issue and being worked on, has something to do with compiler flags. 
Never had a problem with Dev Channel.
Since this is not my primary machine, not even my only chromebook I don't want to change channel.
